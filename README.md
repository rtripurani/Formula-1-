Preliminary Data Analysis on Formula One World Championship

Formula 1 (a.k.a. F1 or Formula One) is the highest class of single-seater auto racing sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and owned by the Formula One Group. The FIA Formula One World Championship has been one of the premier forms of racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950. The word "formula" in the name refers to the set of rules to which all participants' cars must conform. 

This is a global sport being followed by millions of people worldwide and it is very fascinating to see drivers pushing their limit in these vehicles to become the fastest racers in the world!

The Formula One World Championship season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix, usually held on purpose-built circuits, and in a few cases on closed city streets.[3] The results of each race are combined to determine two annual championships, one for drivers (World Drivers' Championship), and one for constructors (World Constructors' Championship).
